# Group Contract

## Goals

### What are our team goals for this project?
We would like to model interesting data, and make novel (and maybe even actionable) discoveries to help refine our data analysis and data visualization skills.

<!-- Not sure it's a great idea to explicitly state the 90% goal... -->
<!-- We would like to model interesting data and achieve a mark of 90% or higher. -->

### What do we want to accomplish?
TBA

<!-- Refining skills, doing a thing, doing analysis, etc. -->

### What skills to we want to develop or refine?
We want to refine our critical thinking skills and develop the ability to create R code that performs useful and effective visualizations as well as data analysis.

<!-- Critical thinking skills and the ability to create code in R that creates useful and effective visualizations and comparisons of any data. -->

## Expectations

### What do we expect of one another regarding attendance at meetings, participation, frequency of communication, quality of work, etc.?
We would like attendance and participation at meetings (and absences ideally explained). For communication, we would communicate via a pre-determined platform (likely Google Chat), communicating potential issues as they arise. For timeliness, we would like to finish the project with ample time to spare for editing and refining further.

## Policies and Procedures

### What rules can we agree on to help us meet our goals and expectations?
Meeting 30-60 minutes before each DSCI 100 class or tutorial a week in order to work through issues we encounter with our portion of the project. Ensure the trajectory is staying towards our goal.

<!-- Hm... should we create a when to meet? I have class xd -->

## Consequences

### How will we address non-performance regarding these goals, expectations, policies and procedures?
Non-performance will be handled via the weekly meetings we plan to do. During these meetings if someone is stuck with their work they can ask other group members how to proceed. Office hours and meeting with the professor is another resource we could use in order to get past struggles.
