# Group Contract

## Goals

### What are our team goals for this project?
We would like to model interesting data, and make novel (and maybe even actionable) discoveries to help refine our data analysis and data visualization skills. We would like to learn new things (such as new statistical inference techniques) and build foundational skills in data science.

### What do we want to accomplish?
Create an analysis of data that is relevant to most people's lives to consider the meaning of the relations between them. We would like to have a report by the end of the term detailing analysis, trends (if applicable) as well as actionable items or recommendations for future analysis. 

### What skills to we want to develop or refine?
We want to refine our critical thinking skills and develop the ability to create R code that performs useful and effective visualizations as well as debugging and data analysis. We would also like to develop collaboration and teamwork skills and gain proficiency with using Git.

## Expectations

### What do we expect of one another regarding attendance at meetings, participation, frequency of communication, quality of work, etc.?
We would like attendance and participation at meetings (and absences ideally explained). For communication, we would communicate via a predetermined platform (likely Google Chat), communicating potential issues as they arise. For timeliness, we would like to finish the project with ample time to spare for editing and refining further.

## Policies and Procedures

### What rules can we agree on to help us meet our goals and expectations?
Meeting 30-60 minutes at a mutually agreed up time every week in order to work through issues we encounter with our portion of the project. Ensure the trajectory is staying towards our goal.

## Consequences

### How will we address non-performance regarding these goals, expectations, policies and procedures?
Non-performance will be handled via the weekly meetings we plan to do. During these meetings if someone is stuck with their work they can ask other group members how to proceed. Office hours and meeting with the professor is another resource we could use in order to get past struggles.
