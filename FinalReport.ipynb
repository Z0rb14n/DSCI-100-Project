    "Europe is the most traveled region in the world (UNWTO, 2023) and there are many countries to explore. In order to have the most enjoyable trip, proper planning and budgeting is required. Airbnb is one of the most popular ways to find accommodation while you travel. Hence, we would like to determine what factors determine the price of an Airbnb listing in ten most popular European cities, how strongly they affect Airbnb listing prices, and build a model that predicts the price given properties about the listing. We will use the dataset(s) from a study published in Tourism Management titled, “Determinants of Airbnb prices in European cities: A spatial econometrics approach”. These datasets are separated by city and type of day and includes the price and type of listing (shared or entire home), maximum capacity of rental, and cleanliness rating, among other factors."
